        <h2>A. Task / Problem Definition</h2>
        <div>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">Athena is the University of Georgia’s <i>student information system</i> (SIS) and houses key functions, including registration for classes. However, the Athena course registration process is unclear and overwhelming, especially for first-time users. Course registration is central to a student’s experience and success because it determines the entire makeup of their semester. Furthermore, registration is an extremely time sensitive process. Many students compete for a limited set of spots in a course, which means there is a strong need for this process to be as seamless as possible. Athena registration relates to the project theme of “educational technology” (EdTech) in “computing education” at institutes of higher learning. The registration takes place on the Internet and enables students to access computing education (i.e. computer science courses), so while Athena registration is not used in the classroom, it is a technological tool that is key to unlocking computing education. The crux of the issue with Athena registration is two-fold. First, there is too much cluttered information displayed at once, which reduces the effectiveness of signifiers and makes it difficult to find critical course information. Second, there are a series of unclear signifiers that fail to communicate the appropriate <i>affordances</i>, and sometimes even communicate an <i>anti-affordance</i>.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">We define a typical interaction (i.e. typical registration flow) based on the UGA Office of Registrar’s <i>written instructions</i> and step-by-step <i>video</i> for how to register for classes. Their written instructions are as follows: <i>Meet with Your Advisor</i>, <i>Check Course Authorization</i>, <i>Check Course Prerequisites</i>, <i>Check for Holds</i>, <i>Check to see when your appointment or ticket time will be available</i>, and <i>Access Athena and begin registration </i>(“Enrollment & Registration”). Essentially, we can understand the registration process by splitting it up into two parts: pre-registration <i>planning</i> and <i>registration</i>. In the<i> planning</i> steps, students figure out what classes to take (e.g. CSCI 4800) and what the authorizations are. To do so, the instructions refer students to the <i>UGA Bulletin</i>, <i>Degreeworks</i>, and <i>Schedule of Classes</i>, not Athena (“Enrollment & Registration”). Also, there is nothing describing what a CRN is and nothing indicating that users should register through a CRN.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">When it is time to <i>register</i>, the written instructions tell students to navigate to Athena. The Office of Registrar’s step-by-step video called “Register for Classes” demonstrates three ways to register: <i>searching </i>for classes, <i>entering </i>CRNs, and <i>uploading</i> classes from the pre-developed plan. Searching is the first method described, and it is the focus for the majority of the video. Also, it is the only pathway that requires no outside information or preparation. The “Register for Classes” video does not describe what a CRN is and does not tell users where to search for them. The video creators have assumed that students know what a CRN is and already have their CRNs ready to enter into Athena. Similarly, the video creators assume that students watching the video already know what a plan is and how to create one  (“Register for Classes”). While there is a separate Office of Registrar video posted online called “Plan Ahead,” it is not mentioned in the written instructions “Enrollment & Registration”. Plus, when new students register at orientation, the<i> planning</i> phase consists of a meeting with their advisor and then soon afterwards, they jump straight into registering, skipping the need for “Plan Ahead” functionality for newly enrolled students.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">In addition to “Plan Ahead,” the Office of Registrar has another video called “Prepare for Registration.” The video title, “Prepare for Registration,” signifies that the video covers all the pre-registration steps. That is not the case. Instead, it only tells students how to check for registration holds. A student might erroneously assume that this is the beginning and end of preparation for Athena for the upcoming semester, when in fact, the “Plan Ahead” functionality is also a critical way to prepare for registration. Also, there is no video that clearly defines what a CRN is (“Plan Ahead”; “Prepare for Registration”; “Register for Classes”). The videos just use CRN in context, which does cumulatively (i.e., after watching multiple videos online) communicate some meaning through context clues, but it is imperfect. Finally, the only registration step that does not require prior knowledge and preparation and lines up with the written instructions is <i>searching</i> for classes.</p> 
          <p style="text-indent:40px">Ultimately, we will be focusing on students with little experience with Athena, so we will use browsing as our typical interaction:</p>
          
          <p class="" style="text-indent:15px"><b>Seven Stages of Action:</b></p>
          <ol>
          <li><b>Goal</b>: Register for Classes</li>
          <li><b>Plan</b>: Compile a list of classes to take (Course Prefix (e.g., CSCI), Course Number (e.g., 4800), and Professor) and login to Athena to register for classes via searching up classes, entering in CRNs, or Plan Ahead</li>
          <li><b>Specify</b>: Search up classes because of inadequate clarity and experience with CRNs and Plan Ahead</li>
          <li><b>Perform</b>: Search Up Classes, add to summary, and save changes</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">The registration page consists of three sections: <i>search</i> for class section, <i>summary </i>list-view of all classes, and a calendar-like view of all the classes registered for. In the <i>search</i> section, there is a form that affords inputting values for fields and affords submitting a form. After form submission, students are presented a table with 14 columns, and the content for typically 5 of the columns are cut off or truncated. There is no signifier that indicates these cells can afford cursor hovering to see the remainder of the text. Also, in the course title column, the text is underlined, which signifies that the text affords clicking. Clicking opens up a dialog box containing neatly formatted course enrollment information such as course description, CRN, meeting times, etc., many of which were fields that were cut off on the main table. While the time to learn with hovering is expected to be small, and while neatly formatted information is available in a separate dialog box, hovering over every cell or opening a new dialog box for every available class option is cumbersome and time consuming. Also, the table column header affords column resizing by dragging the headers in and out, as signified by change in cursor shape when hovering over the table outline, but column expansions come at the expense of being able to see other fields without scrolling horizontally.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">When browsing for courses, there is a gray button in the rightmost column with the text “Add,” which to the student, signifies that the button affords clicking and adding a class to the student’s schedule. However, the actual signifier to affordance mapping is different. Clicking the <i>Add</i> button affords adding a class to the Course Summary window, which is an intermediate step to review course changes before clicking <i>Submit</i>. This misunderstanding results from a lack of user experience and context. It is hard to know what affordances associated with the <i>Add</i> button are until the student has interacted with the system enough to uncover the true mapping. Over time, ideally, students will see that when clicking <i>Add</i>, a new entry for the course appears in the schedule calendar tab and in the summary window with a status of <i>Pending</i>. However, this might not be the case. When using split screen on a laptop or using a mobile device/tablet, only one of the bottom two screens can be open at once: <i>Schedule</i> or <i>Summary</i>. If the Summary window is not open, then a student will never see that clicking <i>Add</i> adds the class to the Summary window, but they will see the course appear in their calendar or list view of <i>Schedule</i>. In other words, the signifier (adding newly Added course to summary) is never visible. There would be no way for a user to know that there are additional steps to take to save registration changes.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">Let’s assume that the student is able to see and understand the true function of clicking <i>Add</i>. Within the Summary window, the unclear signifiers add an additional layer of confusion. Specifically, there is a column called “Status” which contains unclear signifiers. When adding a course to the Summary, the class appears with a “Pending” status. There are no additional signifiers that indicate what a status affords, wasting time for new users that are trying to understand what each type of status means. For some students, “Pending” can signify that the class registration is taking place currently or that the system is lagging or slow. The user might assume that there are no additional actions needed on their side to successfully register for a class. Other users might be skeptical and even feel that the process is incomplete, and they will look at surrounding information to better understand what “Pending” means. When adding a course to the Summary window, even though it says “Pending,” the next column over will display “**Web Registered**,” which signifies that the registration process is completed. In addition to populating in the Summary window, clicking <i>Add</i> will also populate the course to the <i>calendar</i> section. This can also incorrectly communicate that the class has been successfully added and the process is complete. Finally, Athena’s Summary window contains an action column signified by the word <i>Action</i>. This <i>Action </i>column along with a dropdown button signifies clicking of the button as well as viewing of options. There are multiple options which a user can view depending on the date. If the user is registering during the university’s registration period, the system affords <i>Web Registering</i>, <i>Removing</i>, <i>Waitlisting</i>, or <i>None</i>. The user is signified by all of these options. The <i>Waitlist </i>option may be self explanatory, but Athena does not appear to have any additional signifiers explaining the effects of choosing these particular options (i.e. what does <i>Web Registered</i> mean? What does <i>None </i>mean?). The correct use of the system is to understand that the button in the Summary window labeled <i>Submit</i> (signifier) affords clicking and saving registration selections, but in the context of other signifiers, the true affordance may be unknown. If a user closes the window or navigates away from the page, then their registration changes have not been saved. </p>
          <ol>
            <li value="5"><b>Perceive</b>: Users feel the time-pressure and worry that they might make a mistake and not get the classes they want. When they finish, they are not relieved, and still, nervous about whether they successfully registered for their courses.</li>
            <li value="6"><b>Interpret</b>: Users think that there is a lot of information that they have to sift through at registration time and store in their minds while registering. They feel overwhelmed, and wonder why it feels like there are so many moving parts. </li>
            <li value="7"><b>Compare</b>: Users compare registration experience with their goals, and walk away unclear of whether they completed the registration process successfully and successfully enrolled in all the classes they planned to take. </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Identify Potential Users</h4>
          <div>
            <h6>What user population is affected by your problem of study?</h6>
            <p style="text-indent:40px">The user population for our problem is all types of students at UGA including undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Advisors also access Athena to teach students, but they do not register for classes.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>What related tasks do they perform?</h6>
            <p style="text-indent:40px">The students all use Athena to register for classes. They must see if the classes they want are available, add them to their summary page, and register for their selected classes.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>They must search for classes, identify the correct sections that they desire and fit in with their schedule, add it to the summary screen, select the option to web register, and click on the submit button. </li>
              <li>They do not necessarily have to search through Athena. If they have retrieved the CRN through other methods such as Courseoff, an external planning tool, they can also type in the CRN to retrieve the course section they want. </li>
              <li>Athena also provides the ability to create plans which auto-load into the <i>Summary </i>screen. </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-indent:40px">Advisors can help guide students through Athena, so they do not necessarily have to go through the entire registration process like a student would. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>How would users benefit from a solution to the problem of study?</h6>
            <p style="text-indent:40px">With an improved solution, users could get a user experience which gives the user a better experience. Using this solution would hopefully leave students feeling more satisfied instead of stressed as some have felt stressed when using Athena (Fitzgerald, 2021). There would be less confusion from the affordances and signifiers, and without the information overload, users would not have to remember and store as much information in their heads. With less confusion, the user could also be more efficient, productive, and more likely to register for the class that they had planned for. In the end, students would have successfully registered for their classes and could be looking forward to their next semester. </p>

        <h2>B. Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2>
        <div>
          <h6>Describe existing solutions.</h6>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">Athena is a personalized implementation for UGA of Ellucian Banner, but one of the biggest competitors to Ellucian is Jenzabar. Jenzabar One is another form of SIS used widely among colleges. They provide an all-in-one solution for university students, which significantly decreases the confusion and tedious process of registration, mostly stemming from looking up classes and adding to the summary view of Athena registration page.</p>
        	<p style="text-indent:40px">Jenzabar recently upgraded their platform with “new personalized course planning and scheduling capabilities, added granular grade information, and improved registrar functionality, universities can now more easily and efficiently streamline registration to enhance the student experience and transition to a student-centric campus” (“Jenzabar Enhances Jenzabar One Student Registration to Meet the Needs of New Tech-Savvy Student Body Solutions”). Jenzabar is currently the most liked SIS according to a SIS research company called Gartner, and for good reasons.</p>
        	<p style="text-indent:40px">Through Jenzabar, students can now view all of their academic, advising, registration, financial aid and billing information in one place. Instead of looking up classes and writing down which classes to register for, Jenzabar provides a tab that signifies “My Academic Plan”, signifying the courses that are recommended or required for the students. For each course, there is a button with the signifier “Find a section” that affords clicking, and signifies to the user that by clicking this button, the website will display a list of sections for this specific course. For each section, the website displays signifiers such as “No sections available” to ensure users can register for classes that they are allowed to register for. Finally, users can add the section they are interested in with a button with a big blue property that affords clicking, with a big text “Add to my schedule” signifier that signifies adding the section to the class cart. Once that button is clicked, the section will be displayed on the big calendar to the right, and cannot be missed. One of the biggest concerns with Athena was the overwhelming amount of information within one screen. The calendar section is small, making it more likely for users to miss the fact that classes added will appear in the calendar view. The difference between Athena and Jenzabar is that Jenzabar contains a calendar view that takes up more than 50% of the screen, allowing users to see the entire week’s schedule easily without a lot of scrolling. Athena also has unclear signifiers such as “add” and different states for registrations such as “pending”. This can be confusing for new users because these signifiers are not specific. What does “add'' mean? What is it adding? What does “pending” mean? These are the questions that arise when looking at these signifiers. However, with Jenzabar’s clear signifiers such as “Add to my schedule”, it may be more clear compared to just “Add” on Athena because it signifies to the user that this button will add this specific course to the schedule, which is shown on the right side of the page. This may make registering for classes easier on Jenzabar over Athena or Ellucian due to the clearer signifiers and non-overwhelming UI.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:40px">Gartner, a company conducting research on SIS software, shows Jenzabar as being more favorable for users compared to Ellucian. Jenzabar has a 4.3 rating among all reviewers while Ellucian has a 3.2 rating among all reviewers on Gartner’s website. Many users on Ellucian note that “it is complicated to learn for new users”, according to Gartner. This sentiment is shared among students at UGA, such as James Harwan, a sophomore intended advertising major, who said “I don’t think either of the versions are really that user-friendly” (Fitzgerald et al., 2021). Another student, Madeline Spinetto, expressed similar concerns, stating that she felt like she was “thrown into the fire” (Fitzgerald et al., 2021). This is most likely due to the unclear signifiers and the small view window for each section. Jenzabar may not have that problem because of its clear signifiers and less number of windows on one page, and by removing Athena’s summary view window, there could be more space to search for classes and view class schedules similarly to Jenzabar. This can remove the confusion of Athena’s summary window status signifiers such as “pending” when adding classes to your schedule.  </p>
