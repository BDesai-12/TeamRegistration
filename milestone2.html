      <h2>A. Task / Problem Definition</h2>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <div>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">Athena is the University of Georgia’s <i>student information system</i> (SIS) and houses key functions, including registration for classes. However, the Athena course registration process is unclear and overwhelming, especially for first-time users. Course registration is central to a student’s experience and success because it determines the entire makeup of their semester. Furthermore, registration is an extremely time sensitive process. Many students compete for a limited set of spots in a course, which means there is a strong need for this process to be as seamless as possible. Athena registration relates to the project theme of “educational technology” (EdTech) in “computing education” at institutes of higher learning. The registration takes place on the Internet and enables students to access computing education (i.e. computer science courses), so while Athena registration is not used in the classroom, it is a technological tool that is key to unlocking computing education. The crux of the issue with Athena registration is two-fold. First, there is too much cluttered information displayed at once, which reduces the effectiveness of signifiers and makes it difficult to find critical course information. Second, there are a series of unclear signifiers that fail to communicate the appropriate <i>affordances</i>, and sometimes even communicate an <i>anti-affordance</i>.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">We define a typical interaction (i.e. typical registration flow) based on the UGA Office of Registrar’s <i>written instructions</i> and step-by-step <i>video</i> for how to register for classes. Their written instructions are as follows: <i>Meet with Your Advisor</i>, <i>Check Course Authorization</i>, <i>Check Course Prerequisites</i>, <i>Check for Holds</i>, <i>Check to see when your appointment or ticket time will be available</i>, and <i>Access Athena and begin registration </i>(“Enrollment & Registration”). Essentially, we can understand the registration process by splitting it up into two parts: pre-registration <i>planning</i> and <i>registration</i>. In the<i> planning</i> steps, students figure out what classes to take (e.g. CSCI 4800) and what the authorizations are. To do so, the instructions refer students to the <i>UGA Bulletin</i>, <i>Degreeworks</i>, and <i>Schedule of Classes</i>, not Athena (“Enrollment & Registration”). Also, there is nothing describing what a CRN is and nothing indicating that users should register through a CRN.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">When it is time to <i>register</i>, the written instructions tell students to navigate to Athena. The Office of Registrar’s step-by-step video called “Register for Classes” demonstrates three ways to register: <i>searching </i>for classes, <i>entering </i>CRNs, and <i>uploading</i> classes from the pre-developed plan. Searching is the first method described, and it is the focus for the majority of the video. Also, it is the only pathway that requires no outside information or preparation. The “Register for Classes” video does not describe what a CRN is and does not tell users where to search for them. The video creators have assumed that students know what a CRN is and already have their CRNs ready to enter into Athena. Similarly, the video creators assume that students watching the video already know what a plan is and how to create one  (“Register for Classes”). While there is a separate Office of Registrar video posted online called “Plan Ahead,” it is not mentioned in the written instructions “Enrollment & Registration”. Plus, when new students register at orientation, the<i> planning</i> phase consists of a meeting with their advisor and then soon afterwards, they jump straight into registering, skipping the need for “Plan Ahead” functionality for newly enrolled students.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">In addition to “Plan Ahead,” the Office of Registrar has another video called “Prepare for Registration.” The video title, “Prepare for Registration,” signifies that the video covers all the pre-registration steps. That is not the case. Instead, it only tells students how to check for registration holds. A student might erroneously assume that this is the beginning and end of preparation for Athena for the upcoming semester, when in fact, the “Plan Ahead” functionality is also a critical way to prepare for registration. Also, there is no video that clearly defines what a CRN is (“Plan Ahead”; “Prepare for Registration”; “Register for Classes”). The videos just use CRN in context, which does cumulatively (i.e., after watching multiple videos online) communicate some meaning through context clues, but it is imperfect. Finally, the only registration step that does not require prior knowledge and preparation and lines up with the written instructions is <i>searching</i> for classes.</p> 
        <p style="text-indent:40px">Ultimately, we will be focusing on students with little experience with Athena, so we will use browsing as our typical interaction:</p>
        
        <p class="" style="text-indent:15px"><b>Seven Stages of Action:</b></p>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Goal</b>: Register for Classes</li>
        <li><b>Plan</b>: Compile a list of classes to take (Course Prefix (e.g., CSCI), Course Number (e.g., 4800), and Professor) and login to Athena to register for classes via searching up classes, entering in CRNs, or Plan Ahead</li>
        <li><b>Specify</b>: Search up classes because of inadequate clarity and experience with CRNs and Plan Ahead</li>
        <li><b>Perform</b>: Search Up Classes, add to summary, and save changes</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">The registration page consists of three sections: <i>search</i> for class section, <i>summary </i>list-view of all classes, and a calendar-like view of all the classes registered for. In the <i>search</i> section, there is a form that affords inputting values for fields and affords submitting a form. After form submission, students are presented a table with 14 columns, and the content for typically 5 of the columns are cut off or truncated. There is no signifier that indicates these cells can afford cursor hovering to see the remainder of the text. Also, in the course title column, the text is underlined, which signifies that the text affords clicking. Clicking opens up a dialog box containing neatly formatted course enrollment information such as course description, CRN, meeting times, etc., many of which were fields that were cut off on the main table. While the time to learn with hovering is expected to be small, and while neatly formatted information is available in a separate dialog box, hovering over every cell or opening a new dialog box for every available class option is cumbersome and time consuming. Also, the table column header affords column resizing by dragging the headers in and out, as signified by change in cursor shape when hovering over the table outline, but column expansions come at the expense of being able to see other fields without scrolling horizontally.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">When browsing for courses, there is a gray button in the rightmost column with the text “Add,” which to the student, signifies that the button affords clicking and adding a class to the student’s schedule. However, the actual signifier to affordance mapping is different. Clicking the <i>Add</i> button affords adding a class to the Course Summary window, which is an intermediate step to review course changes before clicking <i>Submit</i>. This misunderstanding results from a lack of user experience and context. It is hard to know what affordances associated with the <i>Add</i> button are until the student has interacted with the system enough to uncover the true mapping. Over time, ideally, students will see that when clicking <i>Add</i>, a new entry for the course appears in the schedule calendar tab and in the summary window with a status of <i>Pending</i>. However, this might not be the case. When using split screen on a laptop or using a mobile device/tablet, only one of the bottom two screens can be open at once: <i>Schedule</i> or <i>Summary</i>. If the Summary window is not open, then a student will never see that clicking <i>Add</i> adds the class to the Summary window, but they will see the course appear in their calendar or list view of <i>Schedule</i>. In other words, the signifier (adding newly Added course to summary) is never visible. There would be no way for a user to know that there are additional steps to take to save registration changes.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px">Let’s assume that the student is able to see and understand the true function of clicking <i>Add</i>. Within the Summary window, the unclear signifiers add an additional layer of confusion. Specifically, there is a column called “Status” which contains unclear signifiers. When adding a course to the Summary, the class appears with a “Pending” status. There are no additional signifiers that indicate what a status affords, wasting time for new users that are trying to understand what each type of status means. For some students, “Pending” can signify that the class registration is taking place currently or that the system is lagging or slow. The user might assume that there are no additional actions needed on their side to successfully register for a class. Other users might be skeptical and even feel that the process is incomplete, and they will look at surrounding information to better understand what “Pending” means. When adding a course to the Summary window, even though it says “Pending,” the next column over will display “**Web Registered**,” which signifies that the registration process is completed. In addition to populating in the Summary window, clicking <i>Add</i> will also populate the course to the <i>calendar</i> section. This can also incorrectly communicate that the class has been successfully added and the process is complete. Finally, Athena’s Summary window contains an action column signified by the word <i>Action</i>. This <i>Action </i>column along with a dropdown button signifies clicking of the button as well as viewing of options. There are multiple options which a user can view depending on the date. If the user is registering during the university’s registration period, the system affords <i>Web Registering</i>, <i>Removing</i>, <i>Waitlisting</i>, or <i>None</i>. The user is signified by all of these options. The <i>Waitlist </i>option may be self explanatory, but Athena does not appear to have any additional signifiers explaining the effects of choosing these particular options (i.e. what does <i>Web Registered</i> mean? What does <i>None </i>mean?). The correct use of the system is to understand that the button in the Summary window labeled <i>Submit</i> (signifier) affords clicking and saving registration selections, but in the context of other signifiers, the true affordance may be unknown. If a user closes the window or navigates away from the page, then their registration changes have not been saved. </p>
        <ol>
          <li value="5"><b>Perceive</b>: Users feel the time-pressure and worry that they might make a mistake and not get the classes they want. When they finish, they are not relieved, and still, nervous about whether they successfully registered for their courses.</li>
          <li value="6"><b>Interpret</b>: Users think that there is a lot of information that they have to sift through at registration time and store in their minds while registering. They feel overwhelmed, and wonder why it feels like there are so many moving parts. </li>
          <li value="7"><b>Compare</b>: Users compare registration experience with their goals, and walk away unclear of whether they completed the registration process successfully and successfully enrolled in all the classes they planned to take. </li>
        </ol>
