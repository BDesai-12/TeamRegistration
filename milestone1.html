        Athena is the University of Georgia’s student information system and
        houses several key functions. Of these key functions, we are concerned
        with the process of course registration. Course registration is central
        to a student’s experience and success because it determines the entire
        makeup of their semester. Furthermore, registration is an extremely time
        sensitive process. Many students compete for a limited set of spots in a
        course, and as such there is a strong need for this process to be as
        seamless as possible. However, the nature of Athena’s interface can be
        overwhelming and potentially confusing as the UI displays three crucial
        windows together: Find Classes, Schedule and Summary. Though each window
        is required for registration, students can easily misconstrue the
        mappings of these windows’ signifiers to affordances. This can delay the
        registration process as users misunderstand how they should register for
        courses.

        There are multiple stakeholders in the registration process. As the
        registration process primarily affects students, these are the main
        stakeholders. Academic advisors, especially those who are using Athena
        for the first time and need to build proficiency quickly, are another
        group of stakeholders. From this point on we refer to all stakeholders
        as users. Overall the clarity, quality, and intuitiveness of the
        registration process has significant short and long-term effects. A
        quality registration experience will ensure that users are able to
        better optimize for a variety of parameters, including course rigor,
        time slots, preferred professor, and personal interest. Long term
        effects are even more profound: the ability to register for the classes
        a user needs can affect graduation timelines (e.g. unable to find a seat
        in a required course), GPA (e.g. unwanted boost in course rigor), and
        academic and emotional wellbeing.

    <div>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        One significant way that a user may misunderstand how to register for
        classes arises as they browse for courses. When browsing for courses,
        there is a gray button in the rightmost column with the text “Add”,
        which to the user signifies that this button affords clicking and adding
        a class to the user’s schedule (i.e. registering). However, the actual
        signifier to affordance mapping is different. Clicking on the Add button
        affords adding a class to the Summary window. This is an intermediate
        step to allow users to review course changes before clicking submit.
        This misunderstanding results from a lack of user experience and
        context. It is hard to know what affordances associated with the Add
        button are until the user has interacted with the system enough to
        uncover the true mapping. Ideally, over time users will see that upon
        clicking Add, a new entry for the course appears in the Summary window
        with a status of “Pending”. However, when using split screen on a laptop
        or using a mobile device/tablet, only one of the bottom two windows can
        be open at once: the Schedule or the Summary. If the Summary window is
        not open, then a user will never see that clicking Add adds the class to
        the Summary window with a status of “Pending”. In other words, the
        signifier of a class appearing in the Summary window with a status of
        “Pending” upon clicking Add is never visible. There would be no way for
        a user to know that there are additional steps to take to save
        registration changes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Secondly, even if we assume that the user is able to see and understand
        the true function of clicking Add, they may still misunderstand the
        signifiers within the Summary window. For instance, the “Pending”
        signifier itself can be confusing to a user. For example, a user may
        miscontrue “Pending” to signify that the class registration is taking
        place currently or that the system is lagging. The user might also
        assume that there are no additional actions needed on their part to
        successfully register for a class ― that “Pending” signifies a wait for
        approval from a higher authority and is thus outside of their control.
        Moreover, in the Summary window there are no additional signifiers to
        indicate what each status means (e.g. “Pending” or “Registered”) or how
        many possible statuses there are. This lack of additional signifiers
        wastes time for new users who are trying to understand what each status
        means, but do not have much information to go on. Finally, this problem
        is amplified on mobile devices, because the status of a course is not
        fully visible on such a small screen. The user must scroll left and
        right to find the status of a course.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Lastly, even if we assume that users know what the status signifiers
        mean, there are further steps in the registration process that can lead
        to additional confusion. Athena’s Summary window contains an action
        column signified by the word “Action”. This Action column, along with a
        dropdown button, signifies clicking of the button and subsequent viewing
        of options. There are multiple options which a user can view depending
        on the date: if the user is registering during the university’s
        registration period, the system affords Web Registering, Web Dropping,
        Waitlisting or None; if the registration period has passed, the system
        affords Withdrawing or None. The user is signified by all of these
        options. Though the Waitlist option may be self-explanatory, Athena does
        not appear to have any additional signifiers explaining the effects of
        choosing any of these options (e.g. a user might wonder what Web
        Registered means).
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Overall, lack of user experience is the main factor that contributes to
        these issues. Since lack of experience is varied around users, those
        with less interaction with Athena have a comparatively worse experience
        than others. Another significant factor is time. Though registration is
        an extremely time-sensitive process for students, advisors do not
        necessarily have to speed through Athena to register for classes.
        Instead, advisors have the ability to take in all of the information
        that Athena presents and thus can understand the system better.
