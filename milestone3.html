            <li>
              <strong>Clarity+Efficiency:</strong> As a newly enrolled student
              at UGA, I want a clear display of all course sections so that I
              can quickly identify the best course for me without additional
              steps (e.g., scrolling, opening and closing dialogs).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feedback:</strong> As a student, I want clear feedback

              <strong>Visualization:</strong> As a student, I want to be able to
              view sections of the class I need to take without looking up the

            <li>
              <strong>Visualization:</strong> As a student, I want to review

              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Error Mitigation:</strong> As a student, I want Athena to
              prevent me from making errors and taking dangerous actions (e.g.,

              <strong>Flow + Information Clarity:</strong> As a student, I want

                <li>
                  <em
                    >Justification: According to Estevez et al., one of the key
                    design principles to uphold when designing a course
                    registration system is to ensure that information is easy to
                    access without increasing short-term memory load.
                    Understandability is key when designing a registration
                    system. There is a lot of language specific to the
                    registration process (e.g., CRN, R - stands for Thursday,
                    etc.), and currently, there is no way to look up what words
                    on Athena mean. This means that prior to registration, users
                    need to familiarize themselves with the registration
                    language, which increases short-term memory. The current
                    process violates both dimensions of Estevez et al.’s design
                    principles regarding easy to access information and
                    short-term memory load.

              <li>
                <em
                  >Justification: It is much easier to review changes before
                  submitting them, then it is to reverse changes after
                  submission. By enabling users to review changes and selected
                  courses before submission, users can mitigate errors and
                  time-consuming effort on the user’s part to make further
                  changes, which is aligned with the Golden Principle of
                  preventing errors. Furthermore, a review function lessens the
                  need for a user to remember exactly what changes they made
                  before they submit them (i.e. lessens the load on short-term
                  memory). Estevez et al. also find that a clear distinction
                  with registered and unregistered classes is important, and a
                  review before submitting changes aligns with this principle.
                  It creates a clear formal boundary and distinguishes
                  unregistered and registered courses.

                  Justification: For this user story, we refer back to the
                  Proposed Solution from Milestone 2. Estevez et al. discussed a
                  set of guidelines that led to their design success. One of
                  these was an interactive-time table which is a visualization
                  tool for class scheduling. Presenting a calendar-like table
                  offers the user an understanding of their schedule in the form
                  of time. As calendars are prevalent (citation needed), it
                  could help users process the information smoother. Interactive
                  time-table (proposed solution). While a calendar-view is a
                  potential solution, the broader idea is to give users a clear
                  way to visualize their weekly schedule, which Estevez et al.
                  find that high-quality course registration systems need to
                  have. In addition, some course registration systems like
                  Ellucian Banner and Jenzabar display classes centrally in a
                  visual format guiding the decision to prioritize this user
                  story.

              <strong>Visualization:</strong> As a newly enrolled student at
              UGA, I want a clear display of all course sections so that I can
              quickly identify the best course for me without additional steps

                  Justification: In regards to a clear display, using the
                  guidelines from Estevez et al., we found that this user story
                  is a key part of the registration system. Easy access to
                  relevant information in regards to course sections while
                  reducing short term memory load will help the user have a
                  better understanding of the system and make it easier to use.
                  As UGA brings in more new students and transfer students every
                  year, the consideration to these new students supports the
                  importance of this user story.

                  Justification: The user must complete a certain set of actions
                  to register for a class. With immediate feedback, the user
                  will know what actions they have left and what actions they
                  have completed. Estevez et al. find that students benefit when
                  their registration system provides immediate feedback on user
                  actions as a key guideline to make a successful design.
                  Another idea that pushes the importance of this user story
                  relates to the golden principle: “Offer informative feedback.”
                  In the proposed solution, we stated that our proposed solution
                  would follow the guidelines established by Estevez et al, and
                  this user story provides the avenue to do so.

                    Justification: Students using the system may end up making a
                    mistake while registering. Estevez et. al highlight the
                    importance of direct manipulation of the system when
                    registering for classes, and the golden rules emphasize the
                    importance of preventing errors. The importance of this user
                    story is to make sure that even with the affordances of the
                    system, these affordances do not break the system nor harm
                    the user’s experience. Error prevention is especially
                    important when registering for classes because it is a time
                    sensitive process, and registration outcomes have tremendous
                    impacts on the students upcoming semester.

          <p>
            For this user story we considered two design alternatives. First, we
            proposed an in-page glossary function. Second, we proposed a linked
            wiki page function. In this first design we developed a vertical
            side bar, glossary icon, and expanded side bar. This glossary
            function was intended to work inside the Registration page so that
            users could have quick and simple access to it as needed [5] [6].
            Moreso, users could forgo it easily due to its location and design
            [3] [5]. In the second design we developed a format for critical
            and/or common terminology that would be hyperlinked to a separate
            wiki page. The decisive issues in this design were:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A lack of contrast between terminology formatting and other Athena
              formatting which could lead to confusion amongst users on the
              intended signifier of this formatting [2].
            </li>
            <li>
              Potential errors resulting from being directed to a separate wiki
              page (e.g. unsaved changes) which would be detrimental to the
              users’ goals [4] [6].
            </li>
            <li>
              A significant increase in the amount of steps necessary for a user
              utilizing this function to complete registration [5].
            </li>
            <li>
              An increase in the short-term memory load required of the user who
              has to continually travel back and forth from the wiki page to the
              Registration page [5].
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Ultimately, due to the implementation and design issues with the
            second design and the lack of apparent issues with the first design,
            we decided to move forward with the first design. See Citations at
            end for [2], [3], [4], [5], and [6].

            We weighed two alternatives. The first was to have a seperate
            checkout page to review registration changes and click submit to
            save changes. The other option was to not have a seperate review
            page, but just allow users to submit their changes on the main
            registration page itself.
            <br />
            We decided to pick the first alternative because it is more aligned
            with key registration system principle of a clear distinction
            between temporary and registered classes [2]. And it is also
            well-aligned with Schneiderman’s principle of permitting easy
            reversal of actions [1]. In the second design, clicking submit is a
            final action, but in the first design, a designated review page
            allows students to carefully review their changes, unincumbered or
            undistracted by other action possibilities (e.g., adding, deleting,
            removing, seraching classes). In the second design, student can go
            back to the main registration page if needed. This simultanouesly
            minimizes errors and permits easy reversal of actions. Furthermore,
            a checkout-type setup mirrors successful features of other
            registration platforms like Jenzabar [3].

            We had two choices for this user story: a calendar vs. a list. Our
            choice to choose the calendar goes along with the Estevez et al’s
            guideline for an interactive timbetable and with our proposed
            solution. The importance of visual content has also influenced this
            decision. To support the importance of visual content, Manic states
            that it’s often easier to understand, it is shorter, easy to
            remember, and eye-catching” [4]. The design alternative of the list
            increases the clutteredness of the screen directly goign against the
            principle of “Reduce short term memory load” [5].

            We weighed two design choices when deciding which was the best
            design for displaying searched classes and identifying classes to
            pick for users. One design was to have a list view of classes with
            all the information such as time, class name, instructor name, and
            CRN in one row for each section. The other design was to display the
            list of classes under the search box in the left section of the
            page, while the right side of the page will always have the calendar
            view of the user’s current schedule. The user can search for classes
            they want, and hover over the course section card in the list that
            will be created under the search box. Once the user hovers over the
            course section card, a greyed out card will show up in the calendar
            view, showing how the user’s schedule will look like if they were to
            include the class they are currently hovering over. We decided to
            pick the second option because it adheres to the “golden rules” for
            interface design more than the first option [3]. The constant
            calendar display will reduce short-term memory load since the user
            does not need to remember exactly what time their classes are; by
            hovering over classes they are interested in taking, they can see at
            first glance whether the class will be conflicting with another
            class that they have already added or decide that adding that class
            may be too much load in one day. The constant calendar display also
            keeps it consistent for the user, as the user will know that the
            action they take with classes will be reflected in the calendar.

            Our choice for this idea comes from the amalgamation of the other
            two design alternatives. One of the problems we discussed in our
            Milestone 2 corresponds with the clutteredness of the screen and the
            short-term memory load that came with it. By removing the legend, we
            try to reduce the short-term memory load while still offering a
            signifier to what the user has accomplished. The coloring of the
            notification also encourages us to pick this idea since it furthers
            the idea of consistency [2].

            There are two alternatives. The first is a tooltip that indicates
            error messages. The second is a dialog box that pops up everytime
            there is an error made. The solution we chose was to use a blend of
            the two options. In this user story, we address two types of errors:
            1) adding a class that cannot be added to a schedule 2) navigating
            away from the registration page with unsaved changes. The goal here
            relates to Schneiderman et al.’s golden design principle of
            “preventing error,” [1]. It also relates to Estevez et al.’s
            findings that it is important to provide immediate feedback to
            students when reigstering [2]. We use tooltips to explain why users
            cannot click on a disabled button (e.g., Time Conflict, Permission
            of Department Needed). As Joyce mentions, tooltips are helpful for
            clarifying unfamiliar fields to users. For users, it may be unclear
            why a button is disabled, so tooltips can be helpful to clarify [4].
            Also, Krause mentions to use dialog boxes sparingly, which provides
            additional justification for tooltips [5]. Therefore, we use
            tooltips for more frequent, low-urgency, less-dangerous errors like
            clicking on a disabled button [5]. We use dialog boxes for critical
            errors, such as navigating away from the registration page without
            changes saved. Users run the risk of losing all their work, and
            because the consequences are serious, we want to use a disruptive
            system (dialog boxes) to get users attention [5]. In short, we
            combine both design alternatives, and use both tooltips and dialog
            boxes. But we use each differently, depending on the error and its
            associated severity beacuse both design alternatives have merit in
            different situations.
