              registration process so that I can make informed decisions.<br /><br />
              <b>Solution</b>: In order to make the language used in the
              registration process more accessible and understandable to users,
              a glossary function can be implemented. A glossary icon is located
              in the top right corner of the page, underneath the top bar. Upon
              clicking this icon, a vertical side bar is expanded to the left
              containing a term search function and a related terms function.
              Users can type in a term into the term search function to look its
              definition up. Related terms to the entered term will be displayed
              under the related terms function.<br /><br />
              <b>Extended Description</b>: According to Estevez et al., when
              designing a course registration system, one of the key principles
              to maintain is that of ensuring information is easy to access
              without increasing the short-term memory load for the user. This
              principle is important to keep in mind for this user story.
              Furthermore, understandability is key in a user’s experience with
              a registration system. There is a lot of language or jargon
              specific to the registration process (e.g., CRN, registered,
              etc.). However, despite this significant amount of jargon, there
              is currently no method in Athena to look up definitions. In order
              for a user to effectively understand the language present in the
              registration process, they need to familiarize themselves with
              this language prior to registering. This current process increases
              short-term memory load and violates the dimensions of Estevez et
              al.’s design principles regarding easy access to information and
              short-term memory load.<br /><br />
              In order to address this issue with the current Athena
              registration system, in our prototype we designed and implemented
              a glossary function. This function consists of a glossary icon and
              expandable sidebar which facilitate in place search of and easy
              access to information regarding relevant jargon. This icon is
              located in the top right corner of the screen underneath the top
              bar for purposes of findability and relative priority [7] [9].
              Furthermore, the sidebar containing this icon is delineated
              vertically for purposes of contrast and relative dominance of the
              page (Bradley, 2014; Bradley, 2015). Our prototype, first and
              foremost, establishes a change in color of the glossary icon and a
              change in the cursor from an arrow to a hand upon the user
              hovering over it (Adami, 2015;) [2]. These changes are
              instantaneous upon hovering and signify to users an
              affordance―that the icon is clickable (Adami, 2015; Bradley,
              2014). This is the first step in facilitating easy access to
              information and short-term memory load regarding the jargon of the
              registration process (Estevez, et al., 2014).<br /><br />
              Once it has been indicated to users that the glossary icon is
              clickable, the next step is to expand the glossary sidebar in a
              manner that allows users enough space to search for terms, read
              definitions, and have significant visual access to the rest of the
              screen (Bradley, 2015; Halarewich, 2016). Users should have
              significant visual access to the rest of the screen in order to
              reduce short-term memory load in the event they need to look up
              several terms and/or a term that is significantly long (Estevez,
              et al., 2014; Halarewich, 2016). In order to facilitate this
              access, yet give the expanded glossary sidebar the dominance of
              the screen it necessitates for the users’ attention, a transparent
              gray rectangle is utilized to delineate this space (Bradley, 2014;
              Bradley, 2015). Our prototype implements these design choices
              through an instantaneous overlay that appears upon clicking the
              glossary icon. The transparent nature of the gray rectangle
              covering the rest of the screen, again, allows for easy access of
              information a user may need and short-term memory load for that
              user (Bradley, 2014; Estevez, et al., 2014).<br /><br />
              The expanded glossary sidebar itself initially consists of an
              empty search box placed in its top left corner. This placement is
              due to the relative high priority and noticeability we want the
              search bar to have (Bradley, 2015; Whitenton, 2016). Upon hovering
              over the search box, a cursor change from an arrow to a hand is
              implemented to signify clickability to the user (Adami, 2015). In
              our glossary function implementation, a user will click on the
              search box to simulate typing in a term. We use this method
              primarily because we are not testing a user’s ability to type in
              inputs; rather, we are testing the user’s experience with this
              functionality and overall prototype. Secondarily, Figma does not
              appear to allow the straightforward implementation of text input
              in a prototype. Upon clicking the search box, a user search
              experience is simulated with the term “CRN” (e.g., the search
              input changes to “CRN |” and the appropriate result appears
              underneath the search box) (Shneiderman, et al., 2016). Hovering
              over the “CRN” result box results in a color change for emphasis
              and a cursor change to indicate clickability upon hovering (Adami,
              2015; Bradley, 2014). Upon clicking the “CRN” result box, a
              section appears below it titled “Related Terms” and is populated
              by relevant or similar terms to “CRN” (Shneiderman, et al., 2016).
              At this point, the user can hover each box in the results or
              related terms sections to witness a color change whose purpose is
              to promote emphasis (Bradley, 2014). At any point in this process
              the user will also witness a cursor change upon hovering over the
              search box that indicates clickability (Adami, 2015). Whenever
              clicking a ‘filled’ search box, the expanded glossary sidebar will
              reset as if the user was typing in new input. Additionally, in
              order to contract the expanded glossary sidebar, a user may click
              the glossary icon once more or anywhere in the gray section of the
              screen. This is indicated, again, by a cursor change and/or color
              change (Adami, 2015; Bradley, 2014). Furthermore, the status of
              the search box, results, and related terms section stay consistent
              throughout the sidebar’s expansion, contraction, and the pertinent
              prototype flow (i.e., through multiple states or pages)
              (Halarewich, 2016). This is all to facilitate the easy access of
              information and short-term memory load via the glossary function
              for understanding the specific language regarding the registration
              process (Estevez, et al., 2014).

              <b>Solution</b>: Display the classes in a list style right under
              the search box so that students can view the available courses
              while also being able to see the calendar and see how the course
              fits in with the student’s schedule. If the student wants more
              information regarding the course, the student can click on the
              class box, and open up a dialog or a box that contains more
              in-depth detail about the class such as course description,
              pre-requisites and additional fees the course can incur.<br /><br />
              <b>Extended Description</b>:For this user story, the main design
              choice relates to the calendar. The calendar provides a way for

              support [1]. They stated in their study that one of the design
              guidelines that made their registration system preferred to the
              original at MacEwan University was the idea of an interactive
              timetable. Our design of Athena incorporates this time table by
              including a calendar in a tabular format composed of the 5 main
              weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). Each
              row indicates the hour and is indicated by the Time column. Other
              registration systems like Jenzabar and Ellucian Banner also used a
              calendar-like table to display the course sections that a student
              could take. The interactivity of the timetable is shown when a
              student clicks on the Add button. The selected class is populated
              onto the calendar. The same flow can be seen when the user clicks
              on the Waitlist button. We indicated that our proposed solution
              intended to build on Jenzabar as well as embody the design
              principles given by Estevez et al leading us to the design that we
              have here. In our problem of study, we also noted that
              clutteredness was a problem seen in Athena. Short-term memory load
              is also a problem related to the clutteredness, and we chose the
              calendar format and the adding of hte classes in such a manner to
              reduce short term memory load, a golden principle of design [2].

              roadblocks.<br /><br />
              <b>Solution</b>: While on the registration page, there are many
              ways things can go wrong (e.g., navigating away when chagnes are
              not saved, adding an illegal class for which a student has not
              satisfied prerequsites). One way to prevent errors and dangerous
              actions is to disable buttons that would lead to such a result
              (i.e., prohibit these actions), and instead provide a tool tip
              warning.<br /><br />

        <h5>1. Testing Protocol & 2. Testing Procedure</h5>
        <p>
          As a follow-up and implementation of the research conducted by Estevez
          et al. in <em>A model for web-based course registration systems</em>,
          we will examine if a prototype registration system designed under the
          same guidelines as those evaluated by Estevez et al. would be
          preferred by new users to the existing Athena registration system.
          Such an examination involves the following questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Would a prototype registration system designed utilizing the same
            guidelines evaluated by Estevez et al. be preferable, overall, by
            new users to the existing Athena registration system?
          </li>
          <li>
            How effective and user friendly, for new users specifically, is a
            prototype registration system designed utilizing the same guidelines
            evaluated by Estevez et al. compared to the existing Athena
            registration system on the following quantitative metrics:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Time to register</li>
            <li>Number of errors</li>
            <li>Information clarity</li>
            <li>Intuitiveness</li>
            <li>Visual appeal</li>
            <li>Feelings of control</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Note that the data for these metrics will be gathered across an
          experiment (e.g., time to register and number of errors) and a user
          survey (e.g., information clarity, intuitiveness, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          As such the methodology to be utilized consists of a mixed methods
          experiment in which we will observe participants and conduct a user
          survey following this observation. The participants of this study
          consist of incoming freshman UGA students
          <em
            >who have not used Athena or our prototype for registration purposes
            prior to this experiment</em
          >. This is to eliminate student bias for or against the Athena
          registration system, and bias in student proficiency with the existing
          Athena system. Students will be approached for the experiment first
          when they apply for their orientation date, and subsequently, in their
          first advising appointment. Students will be able to opt-in or opt-out
          of this experiment at these points. Furthermore, said experiment will
          consist of a control group and an experimental group. The control
          group will utilize the existing Athena registration system, while the
          experimental group will utilize our prototype registration system. In
          order to avoid further bias, these groups are blind―that is, no
          student will know whether they are using the new or old registration
          system during the experiment. Ultimately, by combining an experiment
          with a user survey we can maximize our data collection and potential
          analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The choice to conduct a user survey following participant observation
          is primarily because we seek strong methodological control (Evans and
          Mathur, 2005). Take, for instance, some of the primary strengths of
          online surveys as outlined by Evans and Mathur:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexibility</li>
          <li>Speed and timeliness</li>
          <li>Convenience</li>
          <li>Ease of data entry and analysis</li>
          <li>Low administration cost</li>
          <li>Ease of follow-up</li>
          <li>Controlled sampling</li>
          <li>Control of answer order</li>
          <li>Required completion of answers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The strengths listed above are particularly pertinent to the data we
          will collect and analyze. Furthermore, the advantages of utilizing an
          online survey outweigh their potential weaknesses in this particular
          case. The most pertinent weaknesses we have identified to this method
          via Evans and Mathur are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perception as junk mail</li>
          <li>Skewed attributes of internet population</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, with careful implementation and planning, these weaknesses
          can be mitigated or eliminated entirely (Evans and Mathur, 2005). For
          example, by keeping our survey opt-in and only contacting our
          (potential) participants as needed, we can reduce its perception as
          junk mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, prior to conducting the experiment students will be
          provided with all of the following relevant information
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>What is the purpose of this experiment?</td>
            <td>
              To determine the preferability of a prototype registration system
              designed using Estevez et al.’s guidelines to the existing Athena
              registration system for purposes of keeping or replacing the
              existing system
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is their role in the experiment?</td>
            <td>
              A generalizable sample of the user population to determine
              preferability…
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>How does this experiment affect them?</td>
            <td>
              <ol>
                <li>Does not affect actual course registration</li>
                <li>
                  Data is used to determine what future registration system UGA
                  will utilize
                </li>
              </ol>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Specifically, students will be told that we are testing out a new
          (prototype) registration system using them as a sample population and
          that their participation will not actually affect their course
          registration selection. In other words, the course selections and
          changes they make when participating in this experiment do not count
          towards their actual registration. Furthermore, after participating in
          the experiments, users will then be allowed to genuinely register for
          their courses on the actual system. After providing students with this
          information, we will ask them if, first, they fully understand the
          purpose and terms of this study, and then, if they would wish to
          participate/opt-in. Following all these steps ensures that there is
          adequate informed consent across the information, comprehension, and
          voluntariness requirements of the Belmont Report for informed consent:
          students are presented with all the relevant information, understand
          what we have told them, and are voluntarily opting in (Office for
          Human Research Protections, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          We will collect the data on time to register and number of errors
          through participant observation during the experiment. Following this
          experiment, students will complete a survey in which they will rate
          the following factors on a scale from 1-10, (1 being least and 10
          being most): information clarity, intuitiveness, visual appeal, and
          feelings of control. These metrics are defined as follows, where the
          prototype is the treatment and the existing Athena system is the
          control in this experiment:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Time to register</strong> is how long it takes for students
            to register for all their classes using either the prototype or the
            existing Athena system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Number of errors</strong> is the number of mistakes or
            errors users make while using the prototype and the existing Athena
            system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information clarity</strong> is how clear the information is
            presented on the screen according to the participant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intuitiveness</strong> is how easy it was to learn and use
            the appropriate registration system according to the participant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual appeal</strong> is how the participant rates the
            design and appearance of the appropriate registration system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feelings of control</strong> is how comfortable and in
            control the participant felt while using the appropriate
            registration system during the experiment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As all of the above metrics are numeric in nature, data analysis will
          be performed by calculating the averages for each variable across the
          treatment and control groups. In other words, we will calculate the
          average time to register, number of errors, information clarity,
          intuitiveness, visual appeal, and feelings of control for students who
          used our prototype versus for students who used the existing Athena
          system. Thus, we will compare how these averages vary across the
          treatment and control groups to determine our answers to research
          questions <strong>(1)</strong> and <strong>(2)</strong>. Ideally, this
          comparison should reveal how well our prototype performed against the
          existing Athena registration system overall <strong>(1)</strong> and
          specifically across the different dimensions for which we collected
          data <strong>(2)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, to ensure safety in conducting our experiment and survey in
          light of the pandemic, we will allow all students to use their
          personal devices as opposed to computers in public computer labs. In
          addition, students will be provided with device and hand sanitation
          gels and wipes. While this will work to mitigate disease spread
          through touch, it could potentially impact the time to register and
          number of errors metrics. Furthermore, students will be encouraged to
          wear a mask and socially distance themselves from other participants
          if they have symptoms of illness and as necessary.
