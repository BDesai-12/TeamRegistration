            <b>Solution</b>: In order to make the language used in the
            registration process more accessible and understandable to users, a
            glossary function can be implemented. A glossary icon is located in
            the top right corner of the page, underneath the top bar. Upon
            clicking this icon, a vertical side bar is expanded to the left
            containing a term search function and a related terms function.
            Users can type in a term into the term search function to look its
            definition up. Related terms to the entered term will be displayed

            <b>Solution</b>: The user can view their classes on a calendar
            format consisting of the weekdays. Each row corresponds to a
            different hour, and the class takes up the amount of time that it is
            relative to the length of the class. Each of the classes on here is
            distinct in its color depending on the status of the class. It

            <b>Solution</b>: Display the classes in a list style right under the

            also being able to see the calendar and see how the course fits in
            with the student’s schedule. If the student wants more information
            regarding the course, the student can click on the class box, and
            open up a dialog or a box that contains more in-depth detail about
            the class such as course description, pre-requisites and additional
            fees the course can incur.<br /><br />

            <b>Solution</b>: The idea for this user story is to get a

            confirm that all the changes they have requested to make to their

            can avoid issues and time-intensive roadblocks.<br /><br />
            <b>Solution</b>: While on the registration page, there are many ways
            things can go wrong (e.g., navigating away when chagnes are not

            prerequsites). One way to prevent errors and dangerous actions is to
            disable buttons that would lead to such a result (i.e., prohibit
            these actions), and instead provide a tool tip warning.<br /><br />

              </h6>
              <b>Extended Description</b>: According to Estevez et al., when
              designing a course registration system, one of the key principles
              to maintain is that of ensuring information is easy to access
              without increasing the short-term memory load for the user. This
              principle is important to keep in mind for this user story.
              Furthermore, understandability is key in a user’s experience with
              a registration system. There is a lot of language or jargon
              specific to the registration process (e.g., CRN, registered,
              etc.). However, despite this significant amount of jargon, there
              is currently no method in Athena to look up definitions. In order
              for a user to effectively understand the language present in the
              registration process, they need to familiarize themselves with
              this language prior to registering. This current process increases
              short-term memory load and violates the dimensions of Estevez et
              al.’s design principles regarding easy access to information and
              short-term memory load.<br /><br />
              In order to address this issue with the current Athena
              registration system, in our prototype we designed and implemented
              a glossary function. This function consists of a glossary icon and
              expandable sidebar which facilitate in place search of and easy
              access to information regarding relevant jargon. This icon is
              located in the top right corner of the screen underneath the top
              bar for purposes of findability and relative priority [7] [9].
              Furthermore, the sidebar containing this icon is delineated
              vertically for purposes of contrast and relative dominance of the
              page (Bradley, 2014; Bradley, 2015). Our prototype, first and
              foremost, establishes a change in color of the glossary icon and a
              change in the cursor from an arrow to a hand upon the user
              hovering over it (Adami, 2015;) [2]. These changes are
              instantaneous upon hovering and signify to users an
              affordance―that the icon is clickable (Adami, 2015; Bradley,
              2014). This is the first step in facilitating easy access to
              information and short-term memory load regarding the jargon of the
              registration process (Estevez, et al., 2014).<br /><br />
              Once it has been indicated to users that the glossary icon is
              clickable, the next step is to expand the glossary sidebar in a
              manner that allows users enough space to search for terms, read
              definitions, and have significant visual access to the rest of the
              screen (Bradley, 2015; Halarewich, 2016). Users should have
              significant visual access to the rest of the screen in order to
              reduce short-term memory load in the event they need to look up
              several terms and/or a term that is significantly long (Estevez,
              et al., 2014; Halarewich, 2016). In order to facilitate this
              access, yet give the expanded glossary sidebar the dominance of
              the screen it necessitates for the users’ attention, a transparent
              gray rectangle is utilized to delineate this space (Bradley, 2014;
              Bradley, 2015). Our prototype implements these design choices
              through an instantaneous overlay that appears upon clicking the
              glossary icon. The transparent nature of the gray rectangle
              covering the rest of the screen, again, allows for easy access of
              information a user may need and short-term memory load for that
              user (Bradley, 2014; Estevez, et al., 2014).<br /><br />
              The expanded glossary sidebar itself initially consists of an
              empty search box placed in its top left corner. This placement is
              due to the relative high priority and noticeability we want the
              search bar to have (Bradley, 2015; Whitenton, 2016). Upon hovering
              over the search box, a cursor change from an arrow to a hand is
              implemented to signify clickability to the user (Adami, 2015). In
              our glossary function implementation, a user will click on the
              search box to simulate typing in a term. We use this method
              primarily because we are not testing a user’s ability to type in
              inputs; rather, we are testing the user’s experience with this
              functionality and overall prototype. Secondarily, Figma does not
              appear to allow the straightforward implementation of text input
              in a prototype. Upon clicking the search box, a user search
              experience is simulated with the term “CRN” (e.g., the search
              input changes to “CRN |” and the appropriate result appears
              underneath the search box) (Shneiderman, et al., 2016). Hovering
              over the “CRN” result box results in a color change for emphasis
              and a cursor change to indicate clickability upon hovering (Adami,
              2015; Bradley, 2014). Upon clicking the “CRN” result box, a
              section appears below it titled “Related Terms” and is populated
              by relevant or similar terms to “CRN” (Shneiderman, et al., 2016).
              At this point, the user can hover each box in the results or
              related terms sections to witness a color change whose purpose is
              to promote emphasis (Bradley, 2014). At any point in this process
              the user will also witness a cursor change upon hovering over the
              search box that indicates clickability (Adami, 2015). Whenever
              clicking a ‘filled’ search box, the expanded glossary sidebar will
              reset as if the user was typing in new input. Additionally, in
              order to contract the expanded glossary sidebar, a user may click
              the glossary icon once more or anywhere in the gray section of the
              screen. This is indicated, again, by a cursor change and/or color
              change (Adami, 2015; Bradley, 2014). Furthermore, the status of
              the search box, results, and related terms section stay consistent
              throughout the sidebar’s expansion, contraction, and the pertinent
              prototype flow (i.e., through multiple states or pages)
              (Halarewich, 2016). This is all to facilitate the easy access of
              information and short-term memory load via the glossary function
              for understanding the specific language regarding the registration
              process (Estevez, et al., 2014).

              <b>Extended Description</b>:For this user story, the main design
              choice relates to the calendar. The calendar provides a way for
              the user to view their classes in a format that Estevez et al
              support [1]. They stated in their study that one of the design
              guidelines that made their registration system preferred to the
              original at MacEwan University was the idea of an interactive
              timetable. Our design of Athena incorporates this time table by
              including a calendar in a tabular format composed of the 5 main
              weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). Each
              row indicates the hour and is indicated by the Time column. Other
              registration systems like Jenzabar and Ellucian Banner also used a
              calendar-like table to display the course sections that a student
              could take. The interactivity of the timetable is shown when a
              student clicks on the Add button. The selected class is populated
              onto the calendar. The same flow can be seen when the user clicks
              on the Waitlist button. We indicated that our proposed solution
              intended to build on Jenzabar as well as embody the design
              principles given by Estevez et al leading us to the design that we
              have here. In our problem of study, we also noted that
              clutteredness was a problem seen in Athena. Short-term memory load
              is also a problem related to the clutteredness, and we chose the
              calendar format and the adding of hte classes in such a manner to
              reduce short term memory load, a golden principle of design [2].
              By organizing the classes into this timetable format, we have
              tried to remedy the problem seen in Athena.<br /><br />

              <b>Extended Description</b>: The main goal of this user story is
              to provide a clean view of all class sections for the class that
              the user searched up so that the user can quickly see all the
              available sections. One of the biggest concerns expressed with
              Athena was that Athena provided too much information all at once,
              making it confusing for users to navigate and understand all the
              information displayed on their screen. To resolve the issues
              expressed by users of Athena, we devised three design solutions to

                <li>
                  Provide the user the ability to quickly see where each
                  particular section fits into their schedule by just hovering
                  over the class cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provide more information about the class by displaying a modal
                  that will be shown in the middle of the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Quickly search up relevant classes that display top possible
                  results.

              <br />
              Currently, Athena displays a list of classes in a tabular format,
              where each row corresponds to a section of the class, displaying
              information such as CRN, professor name, time, availability, etc.
              as columns. However, this introduces a problem of remembering
              where each section fits into the user’s schedule. The user will
              have to look at the time and think whether or not the user can fit
              this class into their schedule. This violates one of the “golden
              rules” for interface design, which is to reduce short-term memory
              load for users. Human attention is limited, and only around five
              items are maintained in the short term memory at one time, so it
              is paramount to design an interface that prioritizes recognition
              over recall [2]. The consistent calendar display reduces
              short-term memory load since the user does not need to remember
              exactly what time their classes are; by hovering over class cards,
              the user can see if the hovered section can fit within their
              schedule by seeing the exact time the class will take place on the
              calendar, rather than remembering the time of the class and their
              own schedule.<br /><br />
              Also, another major design choice was to include a pop-up window
              to display more information about a class. The class cards display
              the important relevant information such as time and professor, but
              if students want to learn more about what the class is about for
              example, the user can click on the class card to bring up a
              pop-window that contains more information about the class. The
              pop-up window will have sections, and the user can click on
              sections they want to learn more about. The reason the information
              is split up into sections is to ensure users only see information
              that they want to see, instead of users searching for information
              in a sea of information. This modal pop-up window can simplify a
              complex workflow such as providing a lot of information all at
              once [1].<br /><br />
              Finally, we want users to quickly search up classes they need, so
              there will be a search bar that will search for relevant key words
              that are similar to the user’s input. This offers the user to have
              quick shortcuts of selecting the corresponding value before the
              user finishes typing the input. This is in line with the “golden
              rules” of enabling shortcuts to speed up user experience, making
              it more enjoyable to use [2]. These three design decisions were
              chosen with the best practices in mind such as adhering to the
              interface “golden rules”. These decisions will ultimately allow
              users to have a better experience while using the new Athena
              because of three things:
              <ol>
                <li>Reduce short-term memory load</li>
                <li>
                  Provide relevant information while reducing the amount of
                  unnecessary information shown to the user
                </li>
                <li>Allow the use of shortcuts</li>
              </ol>

              <b>Extended Description</b>:For this user story, the main design
              choice relates to the calendar. The calendar provides a way for
              the user to view their classes in a format that Estevez et al
              support [1]. They stated in their study that one of the design
              guidelines that made their registration system preferred to the
              original at MacEwan University was the idea of an interactive
              timetable. Our design of Athena incorporates this time table by
              including a calendar in a tabular format composed of the 5 main
              weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). Each
              row indicates the hour and is indicated by the Time column. Other
              registration systems like Jenzabar and Ellucian Banner also used a
              calendar-like table to display the course sections that a student
              could take. The interactivity of the timetable is shown when a
              student clicks on the Add button. The selected class is populated
              onto the calendar. The same flow can be seen when the user clicks
              on the Waitlist button. We indicated that our proposed solution
              intended to build on Jenzabar as well as embody the design
              principles given by Estevez et al leading us to the design that we
              have here. In our problem of study, we also noted that
              clutteredness was a problem seen in Athena. Short-term memory load
              is also a problem related to the clutteredness, and we chose the
              calendar format and the adding of the classes in such a manner to
              reduce short term memory load, a golden principle of design [2].
              By organizing the classes into this timetable format, we have
              tried to remedy the problem seen in Athena.<br /><br />

              </h6>
              <b>Extended Description</b>: The focus of this user story is to
              improve feelings of user control and allow them at all times be
              able to know the state of their registration. More broadly, the
              spirit of this user story is visual clarity and information
              clarity. Users want to be able see and understand all the
              information shared on the screen, especially as it pertains to the
              changes that they have made to their schedule. Visual clarity and
              information clarity were one of many pain paints in the current
              Athena registration system that we sought to address. Therefore,
              this user story is extremely relevant to the problem study at
              hand. The two design choices covered in this prototype that relate
              to visual clarity and information clarity are:
              <ol>
                <li>a collapsible search box</li>
                <li>status color coding</li>
                <li>
                  separate landing page solely dedicated towards reviewing
                  classes
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              Accordions (collapsible boxes) are used to improve the readability
              of a page and limit the amount of scrolling, so we allow the
              Search Classes to be collapsible, to minimize the amount of
              scrolling a user will need when looking at the cards of “My
              Classes” and “Search Results.” [1] Researchers Laubheimer and
              Budiu conducted an experiment, in which they rank strategies for
              developing accordion, and their main take away is to “use a caret
              icon to designate an accordion, whether on desktop or mobile — our
              study found that of the standard set of icons used in this
              context, only the caret performed better than either no icon or a
              nonsense icon at indicating that than it was an accordion.” [6]
              Students using Athena do not always need to see the search
              criteria or search box, which means that the box takes up
              unnecessary space. This way we increase user control by allowing
              them to conditionally display elements when needed, and we
              increase visual clarity and information accessibility by allowing
              for better spacing on the user interface. More specific to this
              user story, increased spacing and user control allows them to more
              effectively focus on the relevant information to reviewing course
              registration modifications.<br /><br />
              Also, another major design choice was the use of status colors to
              indicate the status of a class and distinguish between permanent
              and temporary states was the use. Harley investigated the use of
              color and icons as signifiers, and found that color and text when
              used in combination yields the best performance among users [4].
              For that reason, we use colors and text in combination to
              distinguish status. Green + “Registered” signifies that a class
              has been successfully registered for, and we choose green because
              it symbolizes a successful state [1]. Red + “Removed” signifies
              that a class is being removed, but has not been saved yet. We
              choose red because it symbolizes a potentially dangerous state
              [1]. Orange + “Added” signify that a class has been added. Orange
              in UI/UX produces highlights important information and invokes a
              calming/warming effect on users, and unlike green is not
              associated with success or finality [2]. This mirrors what we are
              trying to communicate, a sense of comfort with urgency [2]. The
              student was successful in that the class was successfully added,
              but the process is not done until they submit changes. Finally
              Yellow + “Waitlist” signifies that a class has been waitlisted.
              Following Harley’s research guidelines, we pair color and text as
              much as possible, so that the time to learn signifiers reduces
              greatly. And we keep color usage constant across the application,
              so that if it is not possible to pair color and text, then the
              color alone has some signifying power [4]. These status colors
              improve visual information clarity and allow users when reviewing
              their class changes to more quickly and clearly understand what
              change they made and validate that change. For instance, a user
              that sees orange knows that their class has been successfully
              added but is waiting for that change ot be submitted for
              successfully registration. In addition to quickly communicating
              what state a class is in, status colors communicate unsaved
              changes to users, letting them know the process is incomplete.
              These status color improve information clarity, ensure user
              control, and mitigate errors.<br /><br />
              Finally, after “Continue” button is clicked on the maine
              registration screen, the users are taken to a seperate checkout
              page to review the classes that they have added and removed. The
              goal is that having a separate page for reviewing changes a user
              can see what their future schedule will look like before
              committing their changes. On this page, users will not be able to
              make edits to their schedule, so this is a protected space for
              users to see what their schedule will look like. The purpose of
              the page is to be simple and straightforward. We intentionally
              truncate what actions a user can take. This flow is modeled after
              Schneiderman et al’s design principle to “permit easy reversal of
              actions” [7]. It also follow’s Estevez et al.’s recommendations
              that registration system follow a “shopping cart functionality”
              [3]. This page serves as a checkout screen to confirm
              “purchases”/”course additions.” Also, the Estevez et al. emphasize
              the importance of a “clear distinction between temporary and
              registered classes,” so we decide to have a separate screen that
              allows users to understand that their changes are not committed
              [3]. Finally, we offer a back button based on research conducted
              by the Baymard Institute, which found that many Checkout UI’s
              suffer because they fail to add a way to go back from the final
              checkout page [8]. In short, a separate review screen with no
              adding/removing/waitlisting functionality places users in an
              environment that is solely dedicated to reviewing changes. This
              again ensures user control information and visual clarity (i.e.,
              no other unnecessary elements like a search box, search results),
              and it mitigates errors associated with prematurely exiting out of
              the registration process and with incorrectly
              registering/waitlisting/removing classes.<br /><br />
              All in all, these three design choices allow for more user
              control:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  allowing them to have control over what the screen/spacing
                  looks like
                </li>
                <li>
                  allowing them to focus solely on reviewing the accuracy of
                  their course changes on a separate page
                </li>
                <li>
                  allowing them to easily determine the state of their changes.
                </li>
              </ol>
              All these design choices go hand in hand with making sure that a
              registering students is able to review their course changes.

              </h6>
              <b>Extended Description</b>: This user story specific highlights a
              users need to avoid errors, especially those that prevent students
              from registering or registering in a timely manner. One way to
              deal with errors is to prevent them from happening in the first
              place and increase a student’s feelings of control. While there
              are theoretically many types of errors, we focus on two that are
              both prevalent and provide a good example of how error handling
              will look in a completely fleshed out system. The error types are:
              <ol>
                <li>permission to register for classes</li>
                <li>prematurely exiting the system without saving changes</li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              This relates to the problem of study because error mitigation
              allows for both a seamless and fast course registration process,
              an improvement from the existing Athena system. To deal with the
              first type of error, we disable the Add button for courses that
              cannot be added for a variety of reasons: Permission of
              Department, Time Conflict, Insufficient seats. The list of reasons
              is large, but each of them are triggered by the same user action
              (Adding a Class on Athena) and have the same effect (Throwing an
              Error which prevents the student from registering). Since each of
              these reasons are so similar, the prototype focuses on
              illustrating one of those reasons: Time Conflict. Again, the Add
              button is disabled, and when a user hovers over the disabled
              button a tool tip will describing why the button is disabled. This
              user experience can be extended to other reasons such as
              Permission of Department and Insufficient. Therefore a limit of
              the prototype is that users cannot discover different types of
              error messages. All they are able to get a feel of is how the
              error message would be displayed and how they would interact with
              it. This is a limitation that we decided ok because again, the
              list of potential error messages is large. In terms of why we
              picked a disabled button accompanied with a tool tip, the overall
              idea is to prevent users from clicking on buttons that would lead
              to a potentially dangerous consequence, such as adding a class
              with an error. This relates to Schneiderman et al.’s golden design
              principle of “preventing error,” [5]. It also relates to Estevez
              et al.’s findings that it is important to provide immediate
              feedback to students when reigstering [1]. In terms of why
              tooltips themselves, Krause argues that tooltips are a bad way to
              report errors on forms, but in this case, we are not dealing with
              a form [4]. Also, Krause mentions to use dialog boxes sparingly
              because they are “disruptive” and increase “cognitive load” [4].
              Users have to close the dialog box before corrrecting error,
              meaning they have to commit to memory what the dialog box said
              about fixing the error. Because this is not a traditional form and
              the consequences for a dialog box are worse, we explore tooltips
              as ann alternative, and follow the best practices outlined by
              Joyce (e.g., moderate contrast of the tooltip with background,
              brief explanation, etc.) [3]. Trying to add a class that cannot be
              added is not an extremely severe/dangerous error. A student can
              continue registering and using the system in the presence of this
              error. Therefore, we opt for tooltips over dialog boxes.<br /><br />
              The second type of error we focus on is when a user accidentally
              exits the Athena registration page without saving the changes they
              made to their schedule. This is a more dangerous error that can
              totally overhaul and ruin all the current effort that users have
              put towards their course registration. For instance, currently if
              a student adds a class. That is not enough. If a student navigates
              away from the registration with unsaved changes by clicking
              “Cancel” or any button in the page header (e.g., Student,
              Registration, Athena), then a dialog box with a warning will pop
              up warning users. While Krause mentions dialog pop-ups are
              “disruptive” and increase “cognitive load” [4], in this case, this
              is a very dangerous action that will result in all of a users
              efforts being lost. We want to be disruptive, and this qualifies
              as one of Krause’s few cases where they are beneficial to use [2].
              Furthermore, we have designed the box such that there is no
              cognitive overload on the users. As Fessenden suggests, we use the
              dialog box to prevent serious, irreversible errors, and have very
              limited text on the dialog box [2].<br /><br />
              The purpose of the prototype is to demonstrate the two ways our
              system will alert errors to users: tooltip or dialog box,
              depending on the type of error and urgency of the error. A key
              limitation of the prototype is that we cannot generate all the
              different types of errors and error messages because there are so
              many. But all the different errors and error messages generally
              fall into one of the two aforementioned categories. Therefore,
              even without supporting every permutation and combination of error
              message, we are able still able to have the full experience of
              generating and receiving error messages. In short, each of our
              strategies prevent errors from occurring, and the way we prevent
              errors (i.e., tooltip vs dialog, level of disruption) is a
              function of how dangerous/critical the error is.

        <h5>1. Testing Protocol & 2. Testing Procedure</h5>
        <p>
          As a follow-up and implementation of the research conducted by Estevez
          et al. in <em>A model for web-based course registration systems</em>,
          we will examine if a prototype registration system designed under the
          same guidelines as those evaluated by Estevez et al. would be
          preferred by new users to the existing Athena registration system.
          Such an examination involves the following questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Would a prototype registration system designed utilizing the same
            guidelines evaluated by Estevez et al. be preferable, overall, by
            new users to the existing Athena registration system?
          </li>
          <li>
            How effective and user friendly, for new users specifically, is a
            prototype registration system designed utilizing the same guidelines
            evaluated by Estevez et al. compared to the existing Athena
            registration system on the following quantitative metrics:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Time to register</li>
            <li>Number of errors</li>
            <li>Information clarity</li>
            <li>Intuitiveness</li>
            <li>Visual appeal</li>
            <li>Feelings of control</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Note that the data for these metrics will be gathered across an
          experiment (e.g., time to register and number of errors) and a user
          survey (e.g., information clarity, intuitiveness, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          As such the methodology to be utilized consists of a mixed methods
          experiment in which we will observe participants and conduct a user
          survey following this observation. The participants of this study
          consist of incoming freshman UGA students
          <em
            >who have not used Athena or our prototype for registration purposes
            prior to this experiment</em
          >. This is to eliminate student bias for or against the Athena
          registration system, and bias in student proficiency with the existing
          Athena system. Students will be approached for the experiment first
          when they apply for their orientation date, and subsequently, in their
          first advising appointment. Students will be able to opt-in or opt-out
          of this experiment at these points. Furthermore, said experiment will
          consist of a control group and an experimental group. The control
          group will utilize the existing Athena registration system, while the
          experimental group will utilize our prototype registration system. In
          order to avoid further bias, these groups are blind―that is, no
          student will know whether they are using the new or old registration
          system during the experiment. Ultimately, by combining an experiment
          with a user survey we can maximize our data collection and potential
          analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The choice to conduct a user survey following participant observation
          is primarily because we seek strong methodological control (Evans and
          Mathur, 2005). Take, for instance, some of the primary strengths of
          online surveys as outlined by Evans and Mathur:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexibility</li>
          <li>Speed and timeliness</li>
          <li>Convenience</li>
          <li>Ease of data entry and analysis</li>
          <li>Low administration cost</li>
          <li>Ease of follow-up</li>
          <li>Controlled sampling</li>
          <li>Control of answer order</li>
          <li>Required completion of answers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The strengths listed above are particularly pertinent to the data we
          will collect and analyze. Furthermore, the advantages of utilizing an
          online survey outweigh their potential weaknesses in this particular
          case. The most pertinent weaknesses we have identified to this method
          via Evans and Mathur are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perception as junk mail</li>
          <li>Skewed attributes of internet population</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, with careful implementation and planning, these weaknesses
          can be mitigated or eliminated entirely (Evans and Mathur, 2005). For
          example, by keeping our survey opt-in and only contacting our
          (potential) participants as needed, we can reduce its perception as
          junk mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, prior to conducting the experiment students will be
          provided with all of the following relevant information
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>What is the purpose of this experiment?</td>
            <td>
              To determine the preferability of a prototype registration system
              designed using Estevez et al.’s guidelines to the existing Athena
              registration system for purposes of keeping or replacing the
              existing system
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>What is their role in the experiment?</td>
            <td>
              A generalizable sample of the user population to determine
              preferability…

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>How does this experiment affect them?</td>
            <td>
              <ol>
                <li>Does not affect actual course registration</li>

                  Data is used to determine what future registration system UGA
                  will utilize
                </li>
              </ol>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Specifically, students will be told that we are testing out a new
          (prototype) registration system using them as a sample population and
          that their participation will not actually affect their course
          registration selection. In other words, the course selections and
          changes they make when participating in this experiment do not count
          towards their actual registration. Furthermore, after participating in
          the experiments, users will then be allowed to genuinely register for
          their courses on the actual system. After providing students with this
          information, we will ask them if, first, they fully understand the
          purpose and terms of this study, and then, if they would wish to
          participate/opt-in. Following all these steps ensures that there is
          adequate informed consent across the information, comprehension, and
          voluntariness requirements of the Belmont Report for informed consent:
          students are presented with all the relevant information, understand
          what we have told them, and are voluntarily opting in (Office for
          Human Research Protections, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          We will collect the data on time to register and number of errors
          through participant observation during the experiment. Following this
          experiment, students will complete a survey in which they will rate
          the following factors on a scale from 1-10, (1 being least and 10
          being most): information clarity, intuitiveness, visual appeal, and
          feelings of control. These metrics are defined as follows, where the
          prototype is the treatment and the existing Athena system is the
          control in this experiment:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Time to register</strong> is how long it takes for students
            to register for all their classes using either the prototype or the
            existing Athena system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Number of errors</strong> is the number of mistakes or
            errors users make while using the prototype and the existing Athena
            system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information clarity</strong> is how clear the information is
            presented on the screen according to the participant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intuitiveness</strong> is how easy it was to learn and use
            the appropriate registration system according to the participant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual appeal</strong> is how the participant rates the
            design and appearance of the appropriate registration system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feelings of control</strong> is how comfortable and in
            control the participant felt while using the appropriate
            registration system during the experiment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As all of the above metrics are numeric in nature, data analysis will
          be performed by calculating the averages for each variable across the
          treatment and control groups. In other words, we will calculate the
          average time to register, number of errors, information clarity,
          intuitiveness, visual appeal, and feelings of control for students who
          used our prototype versus for students who used the existing Athena
          system. Thus, we will compare how these averages vary across the
          treatment and control groups to determine our answers to research
          questions <strong>(1)</strong> and <strong>(2)</strong>. Ideally, this
          comparison should reveal how well our prototype performed against the
          existing Athena registration system overall <strong>(1)</strong> and
          specifically across the different dimensions for which we collected
          data <strong>(2)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, to ensure safety in conducting our experiment and survey in
          light of the pandemic, we will allow all students to use their
          personal devices as opposed to computers in public computer labs. In
          addition, students will be provided with device and hand sanitation
          gels and wipes. While this will work to mitigate disease spread
          through touch, it could potentially impact the time to register and
          number of errors metrics. Furthermore, students will be encouraged to
          wear a mask and socially distance themselves from other participants
          if they have symptoms of illness and as necessary.
